## Tech Stack & Architecture
The application is a classic single-page application built with a modular file structure. A key architectural decision is the use of Web Workers to run the Stockfish engine in a separate thread, ensuring the UI never freezes during complex AI calculations. The app intelligently manages multiple engine instances for the AI opponent, live analysis, and hints to prevent resource conflicts.
